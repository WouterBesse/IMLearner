# IM Teacher ðŸŽ“

<!-- insert link to website -->
A simple website to help teach Instant Messaging slang to language learners. This project is built using Nuxt 3 and WebLLM.
The website is live at [imlearn.wouterbesse.nl](https://imlearn.wouterbesse.nl).

## Troubleshooting the website
If you encounter any issues with the website, please check the console log in the developer tools of your browser.

Most likely, the issue is related to the use of WebGPU, which is not supported by all browsers. If you are using a browser that does not support WebGPU, you can try using a different browser such as Chrome.
If it is still not working in Chrome, you can try enabling "Unsafe WebGPU Support" in `chrome://flags`. If this still does not work, using the Canary build of Chrome should fix it. Linux has more steps to make WebGPU work.

For more troubleshooting info, please check the [WebGPU Implementation Status](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status) for more information.
